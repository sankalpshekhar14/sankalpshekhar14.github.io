							<hr>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/my.png" alt="" /></span>I am Sankalp Shekhar. I am a Sophomore studying Computer Science and Engineering at Manipal Institute of Technology. I was fascinated with electronics, and code at an early age. Focused more on the hardware part first, I spent time through middle school making small projects like plant watering system, automatic garbage bins, PAPI Lights, with Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I learnt C++ in high school, and for my final project, created a cricket simulation game in Turbo C.</p> 
							<p>In Junior year, I was introduced to Machine Learning and subsequently Deep Learning, and the field of Computer Vision, intrigued me. I am a part of the AI and Robotics club in my university called Project Manas, which aims to develop a self-driving car for Indian roads. We were also the winning team at IGVC(Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition) 2019.</p> 
							<p>My first internship was at the Material Sciences lab at CSR(Consortium for Scientific Research), where I developed a Python module called Thermos, which can process thermograms from open datasets, and gain more insights from it. Last winter, I interned at Ernst and Young LLP, where I worked on Document Analysis and Recognition, and digitization of Invoices and Shipping Bills.
							<p>I had been reading up a lot Game Playing Algorithms and Chess Engines,and made an algorithm to play a game called ElectroSheep, where the task was to corner sheep using a dog, while avoiding skunks. I used concepts of Behaviorial Planning, and Finite State Machines, to define discrete behaviours for the dog, with only the image frames of the game as the input.</p>
